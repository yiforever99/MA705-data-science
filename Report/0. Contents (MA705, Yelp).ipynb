Its stores, not surprisingly, also out-performed its competitors. Their long daily opening periods,carefully selected locations and satisfying amenities ensure the quality of their services, and thus the customers can always enjoy the top-notched coffee in a relaxing environment.   \n\nIn the following study, we will closely examine the dataset given by yelp. Our goal is to explore the potential factors that may have interesting relationships with the star ratings of the Starbucks. By utilizing the data processing skills learned, we will also attempt to extract, transform and visualize the data obtained and try to get a better understanding of the Starbucks business. We will perform analysis mainly focus on the business table and the review table. Overall,there are 188,593 observations representing all business on yelp, and 1,042 observations of them are related to Starbucks. In addition, 22,253 of 5,996,996 reviews in the reveiw table are related with Starbucks. For each observation in the business table, there are 15 variables describing specific businss information from different persepectives such as location and opening time.  \n\nThe objective of the first part of this project is to get a better understanding of the dataset. We will accomplish this by generating single variable summaries and multiple variable explainations. We will start with the dataset description, variables of interest and plans for analysis."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Links to report sections (other notebooks)\n[1.

Dataset description"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["The yelp database contains 5 tables. The first one is the business dataset, which contains 188,593 rows and 15 variables such as location data and attributes, describing the business in yelp. The second one is the review dataset, which contains 5,996,996 rows and 9 variables, describing review information submitted by users. The third one is the checkin table,which provides aggregated check-ins over time for each business. It contains 2 varibales and 157,075 rows.The forth one is the tip table, which contains 1,185,348 rows and 5 variables, providing information as similar as the review table. The last table is the temp table, which is an empty table with similar columns as the business table. \n\nAfter exploring all tables, we decide to focus on the business table and the review table since they contain most of the valuable information. And we would also like to find out more interesting facts from these two tables in the future. Therefore, these two tables are joined for analysis purpose. And we also find out that the top three business with the highest number of reviews are Starbucks, McDonald's, and Hash House A Go Go. Therefore, we dececide to focus on the top one business,Starbucks,and to choose it as our study object. \n\nThen we further look into the Starbuck business. We find out that there are 1,042 starbucks stores listing in the yelp business table. We also find out that there are 21,881 reviews associated with Starbucks in the review table. To be more specific, the records in the review table include 20,968 reviews for opening stores and 913 reviews for stores that are already closed."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 2. Variables of interest"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Our analysis is based on two tables, which are the business table and the review table. These two tables are joined based on the overlapping variable, business_id. And all variables in these two tables can be classified into two categoies, quantitative and qulitative. In the business table, latitude, longitude, stars, review_count and hours belong to the quantitative group, while state, attributes, neighborhood belong to the qualitative group. In the review table, quantitative variables include stars and date.\n\nHowever, not all variables in these two tables are necessary for our analysis. And some of the variables are correlated with each other. For example, one pair of latitude and longitude of each starbucks is used to represent the location. When analyzing the geographical distribution of Starbucks stores, we can use latitude and longitude variables. Therefore,the address variable will not be necessay.Having less columns in the dataset would be preferred if we can get the same results. Therefore, only variables that are unique and interesting for the analysis are kept.\n\nTherefore, we first decide to use varibles such as stars, review_count, state, city and attribute to perform our analysis. The stars variable represents the star rating for each Starbucks. The review_count variable represents the number of reviews for each Starbucks. State and city variables represent in which state and city the Starbucks are. The attribute variable contains other information about Starbucks such as parking and insurance information. We may use some of the information from the attribute variable, such as parking. However, we will not only focus on these variables. If there are any other variables that we find interesting later in our analysis, we will put them in our report too."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 3. Objectives"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Through our study, we want to achieve three objectives. \n\nFirst, we plan to draw a whole picture of the popularity of Starbucks in different states. Therefore, we can get a basic understanding of our research object and decide which part we want to conduct analysis further. \n\nThen we will analyze relationships among different variables that we are interested in. We could possibly find some interesting relationships which will give us more insights about Starbucks. \n\nLast but not the least, we want to explore the possible explanations for the relationships we found and to conclude the possible effects of different variables on stars rating of Starbucks. In this case, we can provide some suggestions to Starbucks, which may improve their business operations."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 4. Plan"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Our work plan can be divided into 3 stages. The first stage is to set the objectives for our study and identify the topics of our work. We will explore the dataset, and obtain a basic understanding of its patterns. Furthermore, we will find an interesting object(Starbucks) in the dataset to study, and then clean the related dataset(find the relevant data records and then clean missing values, etc.). In addition, we will transform some tables, which will be used for future analysis.\n\nThe second stage is to conduct the analysis of single variables, which will give us a deep insight of the topic we choose. We will firstly pick some of the variables relevant to our study and then analyze them statistically, aiming to obtain more information. We will also visualize some of our results, illustrating the findings in a better way.\n\nThe third stage is to conduct the analysis of multiple variables. We will understand the relationships among those variables, and then analyze them. We will also try to explain the reasons behind those relationships."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 5. Summary"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["In order to discover insights about the stars of Starbucks in different states, we examined some of the key variables in the dataset. After checking the descriptive statistics of some variables and visualizing some of them, we find out that there are some correlationships within them. Following are the facts we found from our analysis.\n\nFrom one sample t-test of star ratings for Starbucks as a single variable, we found that the average star ratings of some states are very different from the average star rating for the population. Excluding the states with fewer than 30 Starbucks, we found that AB and NC states are abnormal states with large p-values. We are interested in finding out the reasons that seperating them from the population. It will also require our further analysis on related factors to figure out why their average star ratings are deviated from the population average star rating. \n\nOur analysis shows that there is a strong positive linear relationship between the star rating and the average star rating given by reviewers of a Starbuck store. It seems that the star rating given by reviewers has a big impact on the final star rating. In addition, we found that the star ratings are normal distributed with the number of reviews. It turns out that if a stores with a very low or very high star rating, it is highly possible that the number of reviews is very low. We can see that NC and AB states have relatively small number of reviews. It could be the reason seperating NC and AB from the population. \n\nIt seems that the stars has a very weak correlation with the opening hours. However,for opening hours on weekends, we find that there are something interesting facts which may helpful for further analysis. First, the stores which are closed on weekends have a larger range of the star ratings than those are open on weekends. Second, in most states, more than 50% of Starbucks are open on weekends, except AB and IL states. In those states, only around half of the Starbucks are open on weekends. In addition, we found that most states have similar average opening hours on weekends, which are around 10 hours. Combining with the result of previous opening store analysis, we noticed that SC and WI states have the lowest number of Starbucks stores open on weekends, but they provide the longest service time on weekends. In contrast, NV, ON and AZ have the most number of opening stores on weekends, but they just provide average service time. For Starbucks in AB state, it indicates that 75% of the Starbucks open less that 5 hours on weekends, but most of the Starbucks there have an intermediate level of star rating. As a result, we can make a conclusion that the smaller the number of opening stores is, the longer service time they tend to provide. However, AB state is not the case. It has relatively fewer stores open on weekends but provide relatively shorter service time. That might suggest people in AB state focus more on work and life balance. \n\nOverall, it seems that Starbucks in different states always have different performance. It seems that in the same state, the Starbucks with shorter opening hours on weekends has the lower star rating but depends on which state. For example, for AB and PA states, all Starbucks get the star ratings of 3 or more according to the opening time on weekends. In addition, in IL, SC and WI states, the opening hours of the Starbucks are fixed at a certain length. \n\nTo take the attribute of Starbucks into consideration, we also made an analysis of the parking types of each Starbucks. From the report, we are able to see that each state has at least some Starbucks with lot parking, and only a small portion of the states has Starbucks with garage parking. The street parking of Starbucks varies from state to state. For example, about 40% of Starbucks stores in IL has street parking while in NV, only less than 3% of the stores has street parking. However, the parking types do not significantly affect the stars.    \n\nThe analysis above indicates that it will be helpful for us to analyze more common attributes of Starbucks in different states and to consider the lifestyle of customers when analyzing the effect of our interesting variables on stars. The state variable will directly affect other variables, and therefore, influence the star ratings. As a result, when we consider the relationship of stars and other factors, it is necessary to discuss by regions to get more reasonable results."],"metadata":{}}],"metadata":{"name":"0.
